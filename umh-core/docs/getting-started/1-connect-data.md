# Step 2: Connect Your First Data Source

Let's get some data flowing! We'll start with simulated data, then you can connect real devices later.

## Navigate to Data Flows

1. Click **"Data Flows"** in the left menu
2. Go to the "Bridges" tab. Here you find all of your bridges.
3. Click **"Add Bridge"** (that's it - no other options to confuse you!)

## Configure the Bridge - General Tab

**Bridge Name:** `my-first-bridge`
**Instance:** <Your UMH Core instance>
**Location:** Pre-filled with your instance location. You can add more detail later, but for now leave it as is. In the screenshot, we're defining a bridge for `enterprise.siteA`.
**Connection:** Enter the IP/hostname and port of the device you want to connect to. Since we don't have a real PLC for this tutorial, we'll use `localhost` as IP and `8080` as port.

Click **"Save and Deploy"**. A popup will show the deployment progress and any errors or warnings. If everything goes well, you'll be automatically redirected.

Back on the "General" tab, you can verify the connection was successful. Here we see a latency of "0 ms" since we're connecting to localhost.

If connecting to a real PLC fails, the latency indicator will turn orange:

The status "Starting_failed_dfc_missing" means we haven't configured a data flow yet - we've only tested the connection. Let's actually get data flowing by configuring the "Read" tab.

![](images/bridge-read-header.png)

**Protocol:** Select the protocol to read from. Choose "Generate" to simulate data without a real PLC.
**Data Type:** Select "Time Series" (the standard for PLC tags).
**Monitoring:** Shows the bridge state (currently "Starting_failed_dfc_missing") and throughput (currently zero).

**Input:** Since we selected "Generate", we can create test messages. With real protocols like "Modbus" or "Siemens S7", you'd see protocol-specific settings here. For now, use the defaults: generate `hello world` every `1s`.

**Processing:** The "Tag Processor" appears because we selected "Time Series" data type.

Three required fields:
- **location_path:** Where the data goes (auto-filled from bridge location)
- **data_contract:** Leave as `_raw` for now (no validation rules)
- **tag_name:** Name your data point - we'll use `my_data`

The **Always** section uses JavaScript to process messages. We're not modifying anything for now, just passing the data through.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can modify data here later (e.g., unit conversions, renaming). If you don't know JavaScript, any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude) can help write the code.

The Output section is auto-generated - it sends data to your Unified Namespace.

Click **"Save & Deploy"**.

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

You should now see:
- **Status:** Active âœ…
- **Throughput:** ~1 msg/sec

Your data is flowing!

## Step 3: View Your Data in the Topic Browser

![](images/topic-browser-my_data.png)

Click **"Topic Browser"** in the left menu. This shows all data in your Unified Namespace.

You'll see your data organized as:
- `enterprise` â†’ `siteA` â†’ `_raw` â†’ `my_data`

Exactly as we configured it! Click on `my_data` to see details.

**Topic Details:** Shows your bridge configuration and data location
**Last Message:** The most recent `hello world` message with timestamp
**History:** A table showing recent messages (would be a chart for numeric data)
**Metadata:** Additional information about the data source (we'll use this later)

## Understanding What You Built

You just created a complete data pipeline:

```
Bridge â†’ Processing â†’ Unified Namespace â†’ Topic Browser
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Bridge:** The ONLY way data enters UMH (ensures quality and monitoring)
- **Location Path:** Automatically organizes your data (`enterprise.siteA`)
- **Data Contract:** Currently `_raw` (no validation rules)
- **Tag Name:** Your measurement name (`my_data`)

## What's Next?

**You have data flowing!** This is already production-ready for many use cases.

**Connect a real device?** Simply change the protocol from "Generate" to:
- **OPC UA** for modern PLCs
- **Modbus** for older equipment
- **MQTT Subscribe** for existing MQTT devices
- [See all 50+ supported protocols â†’](https://docs.umh.app/benthos-umh/input)

## Concepts Learned

- **Bridge** - The only way data enters UMH Core
- **Data Flows** - Configuration area for bridges
- **Protocol** - How to connect (Generate, OPC UA, Modbus, S7)
- **Connection settings** - IP/hostname and port configuration
- **Latency indicator** - Connection health monitoring
- **Tag Processor** - JavaScript-based data transformation
- **location_path** - Data organization hierarchy
- **data_contract** - Data validation rules (_raw = no validation)
- **tag_name** - Individual measurement identifier
- **Unified Namespace** - Central data repository
- **Topic Browser** - UI for viewing all data
- **Throughput** - Messages per second metric

**Pro tip:** Everything you just configured in the UI is stored as YAML. As you get comfortable, you can copy and modify these configurations for faster setup of similar devices.
