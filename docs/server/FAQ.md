## I cannot login into ia: factoryinsight / Grafana although I've entered my credentials correctly several times
The username in Grafana is case-sensitive. That means, if the user is **J**eremy.**T**heocharis@REDACTED.REDACTED and you enter **j**eremy.**t**heocharis@REDACTED.REDACTED you will get a failed login message.
