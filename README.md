The United Manufacturing Hub is an Open-Source [Helm chart for Kubernetes](https://helm.sh/), which combines state-of -the-art IT / OT tools & technologies and brings them into the hands of the engineer.

## What can you do with it?

1. **Extract data from the shopfloor** via [Node-RED](https://learn.umh.app/know/industrial-internet-of-things/tools/#node-red), [sensorconnect](https://learn.umh.app/docs/core/sensorconnect/) and [barcodereader](https://learn.umh.app/docs/core/barcodereader/)
2. **Contextualize and standardize data** using [Node-RED](https://learn.umh.app/know/industrial-internet-of-things/tools/#node-red) and our [pre-defined datamodel](https://learn.umh.app/docs/datamodel/) (which is compliant with multiple standards)
3. **Exchange and store data** using [MQTT](https://learn.umh.app/know/industrial-internet-of-things/techniques/mqtt/), [Kafka](https://learn.umh.app/know/industrial-internet-of-things/techniques/kafka/), TimescaleDB / PostgreSQL and Min.io
4. **Visualize data** using [Grafana](https://learn.umh.app/know/industrial-internet-of-things/tools/#grafana) and [factoryinsight](https://learn.umh.app/docs/core/factoryinsight/)
