## Layer 2: Persistence Patterns

This package provides storage patterns and interfaces for managing encrypted data in local and remote persistent stores.

### Responsibilities

- **Storage interfaces**: Define how encrypted data is persisted
- **Cache management**: Handle local caching of encrypted data
- **Versioning**: Track data versions for sync and conflict resolution
- **Metadata management**: Store encryption metadata (key IDs, algorithms, etc.)

### Design Principles

- Storage-agnostic: Support multiple backend stores (disk, memory, databases)
- Metadata separation: Keep encryption metadata separate from encrypted payload
- Atomic operations: Ensure consistency during writes

### Key Interfaces

- `Store`: Generic key-value storage for encrypted data
- `Cache`: Local temporary storage for performance
- `VersionStore`: Track data versions for synchronization
- `MetadataStore`: Manage encryption metadata

### Dependencies

- **External**: Storage backends (filesystem, databases)
- **Internal**: None (low-level persistence layer)

### Storage Patterns

- **Write-through cache**: Synchronous writes to both cache and persistent store
- **Write-back cache**: Asynchronous writes for better performance
- **Read-through cache**: Automatic cache population on misses

### Future Considerations

- Support for distributed caching
- Data retention and cleanup policies
- Encryption key metadata indexing
- Storage quota management
