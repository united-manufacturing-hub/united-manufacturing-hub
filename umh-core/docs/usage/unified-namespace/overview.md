# Overview

Traditional ISA-95 "automation-pyramid" integrations move data **upwards** through\
a stack of firewalls and proprietary databases. Every new use-case requires another\
point-to-point path; the result is _spaghetti diagrams_, data loss through\
aggregation, and weeks of lead-time each time someone asks\
"can I please add this tag to the dashboard?"

The **Unified Namespace** flips that flow:

* **Event driven** â€“ every device, PLC or app _publishes_ its own events as\
  they happen.
* **Standard topic hierarchy** â€“ an ISA-95-compatible key encodes enterprise,\
  site, area, â€¦ plus a _data-contract_ that describes the payload, data sources and data sinks.
* **Publish-regardless mentality** â€“ producers do not care whether a consumer\
  exists yet; that turns "add a new dashboard" into a _reading_ exercise, not\
  a PLCÂ­-reprogramming project.
* **Stream Processing / Data Contextualization** - Bridges give incoming data already a base contextualization and enforce schemas, Stream Processor allows you then to properly model the data top-down.

## Architecture Benefits

The UNS eliminates the traditional automation pyramid's limitations:

- **No point-to-point complexity**: All systems publish to and consume from one namespace
- **Schema enforcement**: [Data contracts](../data-modeling/data-contracts.md) ensure message consistency
- **Scalable fan-out**: Add new consumers without touching producers
- **Event replay**: Embedded Redpanda provides message persistence and replay capabilities

## Topic Structure

UNS topics follow a strict [Topic Convention](topic-convention.md):
```umh.v1.<location_path>.<data_contract>[.<virtual_path>].<tag_name>
```

This structure provides:
- **Location context**: ISA-95 hierarchical addressing
- **Data semantics**: Contract-based payload validation
- **Version control**: Schema evolution support

## Integration Patterns

Connect systems to the UNS using:

- **[Bridges](../data-flows/bridges.md)** - Device connectivity with health monitoring (YAML: `protocolConverter:`)
- **[Stand-alone Flows](../data-flows/stand-alone-flow.md)** - Custom data processing (YAML: `dataFlow:`)
- **[Stream Processors](../data-modeling/stream-processors.md)** ðŸš§ - UNS-internal data transformation
