### ------------- IMAGE ACQUISITION ------------

# Choose between a continous trigger with a fixed cycle time 
#   between each acquisition or a trigger over MQTT 
# Possible values: Continuous, MQTT
# No default
TRIGGER=MQTT

# IF "MQTT" set the time between the trigger and image 
#   acquisition. If a timestamp in ms since epoch is 
#   provided in MQTT trigger message, this timestamp
#   is used. Epoch is defined as January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 
#   (UTC). If no timestamp is provided in trigger message, 
#   a timestamp is generated as soon as message is 
#   received at image acquirer. This acqusition delay can
#   be used to avoid problems caused by varying latency.
#   Use 0.0 for stationary inspection processes to do it
#   as fast as possible without any delay.
# Possible values: Floats in seconds
# Default: 0.0
ACQUISITION_DELAY=0.0

# If "Continuous" set cycle time of your process
# If the cycle time is less than the processing time for each 
#   image, an error is thrown
