// Package adapter's tests are WHITE-BOX (package adapter, not adapter_test)
// because the instance constructor is unexported: construction is inverted so
// the WorkerManager builds instances internally with a ref derived from the
// spec. There is intentionally no exported NewAdaptedInstance seam.
