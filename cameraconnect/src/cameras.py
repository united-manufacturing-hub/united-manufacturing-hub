class GenICam(CamGeneral):
    """
    This class is for all GenICam compatible cameras. Cameras
    with GigE Vision or USB3 Vision transport layer always
    support GenICam. Each instance of this class will be
    automatically connected to the device.

    The class inherits all methods from the base class CamGeneral.
    (see description of CamGeneral) Because of that this class has
    to define the abstract method get_image(). In this class
    get_image() fetchs an image out of the buffer/image stream and
    makes sure that data format is BGR8 to send it to MQTT broker
    with _publish_mqtt().

    Additional methods of the GenICam class:
    The first method _connect() establishs a connection to the
    GenICam camera. Afterwards, _apply_settings() applies either
    a configurated user set of configurations or the entered
    settings in the arguments for the class instance. The user
    set of configurations can be created in the matrix vision
    wxPropView or in most SDK which is provided by the camera
    manufacturer. If no user set of configurations is used
    and no settings are provided in the arguments, the default
    settings of the camera will be used.
    The method start _start_acquisition() starts the image stream
    of the camera.
    The last method deactivate() disconnects from camera.
