## Efficient Go
Note: Your main objective is to write readable, working code.
Readability first, performance second.
### Object Pooling
Use sync.Pool when:
You have short-lived, reusable objects (e.g., buffers, scratch memory, request state). Pooling avoids repeated allocations and lets you recycle memory efficiently.
Allocation overhead or GC churn is measurable and significant. Reusing objects reduces the number of heap allocations, which in turn lowers garbage collection frequency and pause times.
The object’s lifecycle is local and can be reset between uses. When objects don’t need complex teardown and are safe to reuse after a simple reset, pooling is straightforward and effective.
You want to reduce pressure on the garbage collector in high-throughput systems. In systems handling thousands of requests per second, pooling helps maintain consistent performance and minimizes GC-related latency spikes.
Avoid sync.Pool when:
Objects are long-lived or shared across multiple goroutines. sync.Pool is optimized for short-lived, single-use objects and doesn’t manage shared ownership or coordination.
The reuse rate is low and pooled objects are not frequently accessed. If objects sit idle in the pool, you gain little benefit and may even waste memory.
Predictability or lifecycle control is more important than allocation speed. Pooling makes lifecycle tracking harder and may not be worth the tradeoff.
Memory savings are negligible or code complexity increases significantly. If pooling doesn’t provide clear benefits, it can add unnecessary complexity to otherwise simple code.
### Memory Preallocation
Preallocate when:
The number of elements in slices or maps is known or reasonably predictable. Allocating memory up front avoids the cost of repeated resizing as the data structure grows.
Your application involves tight loops or high-throughput data processing. Preallocation reduces per-iteration overhead and helps maintain steady performance under load.
Minimizing garbage collection overhead is crucial for your application's performance. Fewer allocations mean less work for the garbage collector, resulting in lower latency and more consistent behavior.
Avoid preallocation when:
The data size is highly variable and unpredictable. Allocating too much or too little memory can either waste resources or negate the performance benefit.
Over-allocation risks significant memory waste. Reserving more memory than needed can increase your application’s footprint unnecessarily.
You're prematurely optimizing—always profile to confirm the benefit. Preallocation is helpful, but only when it solves a real, measurable problem in your workload.
### Struct field alignment
Always align structs. It's free to implement and often leads to better memory efficiency without changing any logic—only field order needs to be adjusted.
Guidelines for struct alignment:
Order fields by decreasing size to reduce internal padding. Larger fields first help prevent unnecessary gaps caused by alignment rules.
Group same-sized fields together to optimize memory layout. This ensures fields can be packed tightly without additional padding.
Use padding deliberately to separate fields accessed by different goroutines. Preventing false sharing can improve performance in concurrent applications.
Avoid interleaving small and large fields. Mixing sizes leads to inefficient memory usage due to extra alignment padding between fields.
Use the fieldalignment linter to verify. This tool helps catch suboptimal layouts automatically during development.
### Zero-Copy
Zero-copy techniques are highly beneficial for:
Network servers handling large amounts of concurrent data streams. Avoiding unnecessary memory copies helps reduce CPU usage and latency, especially under high load.
Applications with heavy I/O operations like file streaming or real-time data processing. Zero-copy allows data to move through the system efficiently without redundant allocations or copies.
Warning
Zero-copy should be used judiciously. Since slices share underlying memory, care must be taken to prevent unintended data mutations. Shared memory can lead to subtle bugs if one part of the system modifies data still in use elsewhere. Zero-copy can also introduce additional complexity, so it’s important to measure and confirm that the performance gains are worth the tradeoffs.
### Stack Allocations and Escape Analysis
When to Avoid Escape
In performance-critical paths. Reducing heap usage in tight loops or latency-sensitive code lowers GC pressure and speeds up execution.
For short-lived, small objects. These can be efficiently stack-allocated without involving the garbage collector, reducing memory churn.
When you control the full call chain. If the object stays within your code and you can restructure it to avoid escape, it’s often worth the small refactor.
If profiling reveals GC bottlenecks. Escape analysis helps you target and shrink memory-heavy allocations identified in real-world traces.
When It’s Fine to Let Values Escape
When returning values from constructors or factories. Returning a pointer from NewThing() is idiomatic Go—even if it causes an escape, it improves clarity and usability.
When objects must outlive the function. If you're storing data in a global, sending to a goroutine, or saving it in a struct, escaping is necessary and correct.
When allocation size is small and infrequent. If the heap allocation isn’t in a hot path, the benefit of avoiding it is often negligible.
When preventing escape hurts readability. Writing awkward code to keep everything on the stack can reduce maintainability for a micro-optimization that won’t matter.
### Goroutine Worker Pools
Use a goroutine worker pool when:
You have a large or unbounded stream of incoming work. A pool helps prevent unbounded goroutine growth, which can lead to memory exhaustion and degraded system performance.
Processing tasks concurrently can overwhelm system resources. Worker pools provide backpressure and resource control by capping concurrency, helping you avoid CPU thrashing, connection saturation, or I/O overload.
You want to limit the number of parallel operations for stability. Controlling the number of active workers reduces the risk of spikes in system load, improving predictability and service reliability under pressure.
Tasks are relatively uniform in cost and benefit from queuing. When task sizes are similar, a fixed pool size ensures efficient throughput and fair task distribution without excessive coordination overhead.
Avoid a worker pool when:
Each task must be processed immediately with minimal latency. Queuing in a worker pool introduces delay. For latency-critical tasks, direct goroutine spawning avoids the scheduling overhead.
You can rely on Go's scheduler for natural load balancing in low-load scenarios. In light workloads, the overhead of managing a pool may outweigh its benefits. Go’s scheduler can often handle lightweight parallelism efficiently on its own.
Workload volume is small and bounded. Spinning up goroutines directly keeps code simpler for limited, predictable workloads without risking uncontrolled growth.
### Atomic Operations & Synchronization Primitives
When to Use Atomic Operations vs. Mutexes
Atomic operations shine in simple, high-frequency scenarios—counters, flags, coordination signals—where the cost of a lock would be disproportionate. They avoid lock queues and reduce context switching. But they come with limitations: no grouping of multiple operations, no rollback, and increased complexity when applied beyond their niche.
Mutexes remain the right tool for managing complex shared state, protecting multi-step critical sections, and maintaining invariants. They're easier to reason and generally safer when logic grows beyond a few lines.
Choosing between atomics and locks isn't about ideology but scope. When the job is simple, atomics get out of the way. When the job gets complex, locks keep you safe.
### Layze Initialization
When to Choose Lazy Initialization
When resource initialization is costly or involves I/O. Delaying construction avoids paying the cost of setup—like opening files, querying databases, or loading large structures—unless it’s actually needed.
To improve startup performance and memory efficiency. Deferring work until first use allows your application to start faster and avoid allocating memory for resources that may never be used.
When not all resources are needed immediately or at all during runtime. Lazy initialization helps you avoid initializing fields or services that only apply in specific code paths.
To guarantee a block of code executes exactly once despite repeated calls. Using tools like sync.Once ensures thread-safe, one-time setup in concurrent environments.
### Immutable Data Sharing
Immutable data sharing is ideal when:
The data is read-heavy and write-light (e.g., configuration, feature flags, global mappings). This works well because the cost of creating new immutable versions is amortized over many reads, and avoiding locks provides a performance boost.
You want to minimize locking without sacrificing safety. By sharing read-only data, you remove the need for mutexes or coordination, reducing the chances of deadlocks or race conditions.
You can tolerate minor delays between update and read (eventual consistency). Since data updates are not coordinated with readers, there might be a small delay before all goroutines see the new version. If exact timing isn't critical, this tradeoff simplifies your concurrency model.
It’s less suitable when updates must be transactional across multiple pieces of data or happen frequently. In those cases, the cost of repeated copying or lack of coordination can outweigh the benefits.
### Efficient Context Management
Always pass context.Context explicitly, typically as the first argument to a function. This makes context propagation transparent and traceable, especially across API boundaries or service layers. Don’t store contexts in struct fields or global variables. Doing so can lead to stale contexts being reused unintentionally and make cancellation logic harder to reason about.
Use 1 only for request-scoped metadata, not to pass business logic or application state. Overusing context for general-purpose data storage leads to tight coupling and makes testing and tracing harder.
Check ctx.Err() to differentiate between context.Canceled and context.DeadlineExceeded where needed. This allows your application to respond appropriately—for example, distinguishing between user-initiated cancellation and timeouts.
### Efficient Buffering
Use buffering when:
Performing frequent, small-sized I/O operations. Buffering groups small writes or reads into larger batches, which reduces the overhead of each individual operation.
Reducing syscall overhead is crucial. Fewer syscalls mean lower context-switching costs and improved performance, especially in I/O-heavy applications.
High throughput is more important than minimal latency. Buffered I/O can increase total data processed per second, even if it introduces slight delays in delivery.
Avoid buffering when:
Immediate data availability and low latency are critical. Buffers introduce delays by design, which can be unacceptable in real-time or interactive systems.
Buffering excessively might lead to uncontrolled memory usage. Without limits or proper flushing, buffers can grow large and put pressure on system memory.
### Batching Operations
Use batching when:
Individual operations are expensive (e.g., I/O, RPC, DB writes). Grouping multiple operations into a single batch reduces the overhead of repeated calls and improves efficiency.
The system benefits from reducing the frequency of external interactions. Fewer external calls can ease load on downstream systems and reduce contention or rate-limiting issues.
You have some tolerance for per-item latency in favor of higher throughput. Batching introduces slight delays but can significantly increase overall system throughput.
Avoid batching when:
Immediate action is required for each individual input. Delaying processing to build a batch may violate time-sensitive requirements.
Holding data introduces risk (e.g., crash before flush). If data must be processed or persisted immediately to avoid loss, batching can be unsafe.
Predictable latency is more important than throughput. Batching adds variability in timing, which may not be acceptable in systems with strict latency expectations.
