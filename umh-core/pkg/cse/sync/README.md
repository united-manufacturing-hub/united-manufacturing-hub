# pkg/cse/sync

## Sync Orchestration Layer

This package orchestrates the synchronization of encrypted data between local storage and remote systems.

### Responsibilities

- **Sync state management**: Track what data needs synchronization
- **Retry logic**: Handle transient failures during sync operations
- **Conflict resolution**: Decide how to handle concurrent modifications
- **Progress tracking**: Report sync status to callers

### Design Principles

- Composable: Work with any storage and protocol layer implementations
- Observable: Provide clear visibility into sync state and progress
- Resilient: Handle network failures, partial syncs, and interruptions

### Key Components

- `SyncEngine`: Core orchestration logic
- `SyncQueue`: Prioritize and schedule sync operations
- `ConflictResolver`: Handle data conflicts during sync
- `ProgressTracker`: Monitor sync progress and report metrics

### Dependencies

- **Internal**: `pkg/cse/storage` (persistence), `pkg/cse/protocol` (transport)
- **External**: Context management, metrics libraries

### Sync Strategies

- **Immediate**: Sync on every write (high consistency, high latency)
- **Batched**: Accumulate writes and sync periodically (lower latency, eventual consistency)
- **On-demand**: Sync only when explicitly requested (manual control)

### Future Considerations

- Support for partial/incremental syncs
- Bandwidth throttling and QoS controls
- Multi-region sync topologies
