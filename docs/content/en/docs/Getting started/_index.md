## Overall structure

As this projects consists out of various components and sub-components one can easily feel lost. We documented every component, their purpose and how they are integrated:

- for a high level architecture and overview over how data is processed take a look [here]({{< ref "/docs/Concepts/dataprocessing" >}} )
- An explanation of the overall folder structure can be found [here](folder-structure.md)

## Setting up and configuring the edge devices

One important part of the stack is extracting and pre-processing the data. The full tutorial on how to setup the edge devices and how to configure them for your specific use-case take a look at the [getting started with the hardware guide](edge/getting-started.md). If you just want to learn more about the edge architecture, you can take a look [here](edge/architecture.md).

## Setting up and configuring the server components and dashboards

The other important part is the server architecture, where the data is processed, stored and visualized. The full tutorial on how to setup the server components and how to configure the dashboards take a look at the [getting started with the server guide](server/getting-started.md). If you just want to learn more about the server architecture, you can take a look [here](server/architecture.md).
