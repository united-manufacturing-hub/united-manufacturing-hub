<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The United Manufacturing System is an open source solution for extracting and analyzing data from manufacturing plants and sensors. The Hub includes both software and hardware components to enable the retrofit of productions plants by plug-and-play as well as to integrate existing machine PLCs and IT systems. The result is an end-to-end solution for various questions in manufacturing such as the optimization of production through OEE analysis, preventive maintenance through condition analysis and quality improvement through stop analysis.
