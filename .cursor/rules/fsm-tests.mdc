# CursorRules for FSM Testing

This document outlines fundamental rules and guidelines for writing and maintaining test code in our FSM system. It applies both to the **internal test utilities** (in `internal/fsmtest`) and the **test suites** (in `test/fsm/...` or wherever the new test files reside).

## Overview

Our project has two major layers of logic:

1. **Manager** (e.g. `S6Manager`, `BenthosManager`), which orchestrates multiple instances based on some higher-level configuration.
2. **Instance** (e.g. `S6Instance`, `BenthosInstance`), which maintains an internal finite-state machine (FSM) and transitions through various sub-states (e.g., “starting,” “degraded,” “stopping,” etc.).

To keep the tests readable and maintainable, we separate **manager tests** from **instance tests** and limit how they interact with each other’s concerns. This is similar to how Kubernetes controllers are tested (controller logic vs. underlying resource logic).

## Fundamental Rules

### 1. Manager Tests Must **Not** Micromanage Instances

**Rule**: Manager tests focus on *manager-level* behavior:
- They **only** call the manager’s public methods (e.g., `Reconcile(ctx, config, tick)`), and then check the manager’s public API (like `GetInstances()`) or high-level instance states (e.g., “is it Running or Removed?”).
- They **do not** manually set or force an instance’s internal sub-state (like “Creating” or “Starting”).  
- They **do not** directly call the instance’s `Reconcile()` or sub-FSM transitions.

**Why**: This ensures each suite tests only its own layer’s logic. Manager tests verify that “adding a config entry leads to a new instance eventually becoming stable,” not the micro-steps inside the instance’s state machine.

### 2. Instance Tests Cover All FSM Transitions

**Rule**: Instance tests thoroughly test the per-instance state machine:
- They can manually force sub-states, set flags on the mock service (like “S6 is running,” “Benthos config loaded,” etc.), see Rule 8 for more details.
- They verify transitions (e.g. `ToBeCreated` → `Creating` → `Stopped`, `Stopped` → `Starting` → `Degraded` → `Active`, etc.).
- They do **not** manage multiple instances. Each test is about a single instance’s FSM logic.

**Why**: This ensures we do not replicate the same sub-state checks in the manager test suite. All the complexity of how an instance transitions is local to the instance tests.

### 3. Use the Internal `fsmtest` Helpers

**Rule**: Common test actions, like:
- **Creating a mock instance** and attaching a mock service,
- **Transitioning** a service from “S6 down” to “S6 up,”
- **Waiting** for a manager to finish reconciling a config,

should live in the **internal `fsmtest`** package. Tests in `test/fsm/...` or in `pkg/fsm/...` can import these helpers to avoid duplicating code.

**Why**: Centralizing repeated setup/teardown or state simulation in `fsmtest` keeps tests consistent, easier to read, and reduces maintenance overhead.

### 4. Manager Tests Use High-Level “Wait” Helpers

**Rule**: When manager tests need to confirm that an instance is stable, they should use high-level helpers like:

```go
WaitForManagerInstanceState(ctx, manager, fullConfig, instanceName, "Running", maxAttempts, tick, /*debug*/ false)
```

rather than individually calling sub-states or toggling flags. This helper:
1. Calls `manager.Reconcile(...)` in a loop,
2. Looks if the instance is in the final desired (public) state—like `Running`, `Stopped`, or `Removed`,
3. Exits once stable or times out.

**Why**: This ensures the manager test does not “reach into” the instance’s private details.

### 5. Instance Tests Can Manipulate the Mock Directly

**Rule**: In **instance** tests, it is fine to do:

```go
mockService.SetServiceState("my-service", ServiceStateFlags{
   IsS6Running: true,
   IsHealthchecksPassed: false,
   ...
})
err, _ := instance.Reconcile(ctx, tick)
```

because you **are** focusing on the instance’s FSM reaction to each scenario. You might also use small wrappers in `fsmtest` (e.g., `TransitionToBenthosState(mockService, "Idle")`) that set the correct flags internally.

**Why**: The instance test suite is the place to confirm every micro-transition. Directly controlling the mock environment is typical.

### 6. Avoid Repetition of Logic

**Rule**: If you see the same “set up service as S6 down, call Reconcile, check for final state” logic repeated in multiple tests, move it into a function in `fsmtest`. Keep only the scenario’s unique steps in each test.

**Why**: Minimizes copy-paste errors and makes future changes simpler.

### 7. Keep the MECE Approach in Mind

We aim to have a **M**utually **E**xclusive, **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive set of test scenarios. For example:

- **Manager Tests** might have:
  - “Empty config => No instances”  
  - “Add single service => instance is created => stable”  
  - “Add multiple services => manager handles them”  
  - “Remove service => instance is removed”  
  - “Port allocation fails => manager errors”  
  - etc.

- **Instance Tests** might have:
  - “toBeCreated => creating => stopped”  
  - “stopped => starting => idle => active”  
  - “active => degraded => recovers => idle => active”  
  - “stopping => stopped”  
  - etc.

No single test attempts to cover all of these transitions in one place; they’re distributed in a cohesive, non-overlapping way.

### 8. Never Call Reconcile Directly
- Tests should never call instance.Reconcile() directly
- Instead use helper functions:
   * TestS6StateTransition - for testing state transitions
   * StabilizeS6Instance - for verifying state stability
   * WaitForInstanceState - for waiting for a specific state
- This ensures consistent handling of reconciliation, proper tick management,
   and standard error handling across all tests

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **For Manager Tests**  
   - Create or modify them in `test/fsm/<manager>_test.go` (or in the `pkg/fsm/...` if your structure allows), but ensure you only call the manager’s public methods.  
   - Use the “`WaitForManagerInstanceState`” helper to confirm final states.  
   - If you must create a mock instance for some reason, call a `fsmtest.SetupMock<Manager>` function so you aren’t directly messing with instance states.

2. **For Instance Tests**  
   - Keep them in `test/fsm/<instance>_test.go` or `pkg/fsm/<instance>_test.go`.  
   - Freely call `instance.Reconcile(...)`, manipulate the `mockService` states, and verify each transition.  
   - If certain logic is repeated, factor it into `fsmtest` (e.g., “StopService,” “StartService,” “DegradeService” helpers).

3. **In `internal/fsmtest`**  
   - Provide well-documented helpers for:
     - Creating or destroying mocks,  
     - Setting up config objects,  
     - Waiting for states,  
     - Transitioning from one sub-state to another quickly.  
   - Keep it minimal but complete—only add new helpers if multiple tests truly need them.

4. **Pull Request / Commit Strategy**  
   - If rewriting or migrating old tests, do it incrementally: keep old tests until the new ones are confirmed to cover the same scenarios.  
   - Merge the final step once you’ve verified coverage is at least as high as before.

## Conclusion

Following these **CursorRules** will ensure:

- Manager and instance tests remain **well-separated** and **non-overlapping**.
- **High‐level** manager tests remain short and stable, testing orchestration rather than micro-FSM steps.
- **Detailed** instance tests thoroughly cover state transitions without polluting manager logic.
- The `fsmtest` package remains the **single source** of utility code, preventing duplicated or inconsistent logic across multiple test files.

By adhering to these guidelines, we guarantee a **maintainable**, **MECE**, and **well‐organized** test suite for our FSM systems.
