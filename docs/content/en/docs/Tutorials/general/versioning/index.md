  This article explains how version numbers are typically structured in IT.

In IT Semantic Versioning has established itself as the standard to describe versions. It consists out of the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, e.g., `1.0.0`. 

`MAJOR` is incremented when making incompatible API changes.

`MINOR` is incremented when you add functionality

`PATCH` is incremented when you make bug fixes

If the version is followed by a '-' sign, then it means it is a pre-release and not stable yet. **Therefore, the latest stable version means the highest version available that is not a pre-release / has no '-' sign.**

More information can be found in the [specification of Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/).
