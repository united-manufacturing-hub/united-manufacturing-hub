# Step 2: Connect Your First Data Source

Let's get some data flowing! We'll start with simulated data, then you can connect real devices later.

## Navigate to Data Flows

1. Click **"Data Flows"** in the left menu
2. Go to the "Bridges" tab. Here you find all of your bridges.
3. Click **"Add Bridge"** (that's it - no other options to confuse you!)

![Data Flow](./images/data-flow.png)

## Configure the Bridge - General Tab

- **Bridge Name:** `my-first-bridge`
- **Instance:** Your UMH Core instance
- **Location:** Pre-filled with your instance location. You can add more detail later, but for now leave it as is. In the screenshot, we're defining a bridge for `enterprise.siteA`.
- **Connection:** Enter the IP/hostname and port of the device you want to connect to. Since we don't have a real PLC for this tutorial, we'll use `localhost` as IP and `8080` as port.

![Bridge General Configuration](./images/bridge-general.png)

Click **"Save and Deploy"**. A popup will show the deployment progress and any errors or warnings. If everything goes well, you'll be automatically redirected.

![Bridge Deploy Status](./images/bridge-general-deploy.png)

Back on the "General" tab, you can verify the connection was successful. Here we see a latency of "0 ms" since we're connecting to localhost.

![Bridge Latency Good](./images/bridge-general-latency.png)

If connecting to a real PLC fails, the latency indicator will turn orange:

![Bridge Latency Bad](./images/bridge-general-latency-bad.png)

The status "Starting_failed_dfc_missing" means we haven't configured a data flow yet - we've only tested the connection. Let's actually get data flowing by configuring the "Read" tab.

![Bridge Read Header](./images/bridge-read-header.png)

- **Protocol:** Select the protocol to read from. Choose "Generate" to simulate data without a real PLC.
- **Data Type:** Select "Time Series" (the standard for PLC tags).
- **Monitoring:** Shows the bridge state (currently "Starting_failed_dfc_missing") and throughput (currently zero).

![Bridge Read Input](./images/bridge-read-input.png)

- **Input:** Since we selected "Generate", we can create test messages. With real protocols like "Modbus" or "Siemens S7", you'd see protocol-specific settings here. For now, use the defaults: generate `hello world` every `1s`.

![Bridge Read Processing](./images/bridge-read-processing.png)

- **Processing:** The "Tag Processor" appears because we selected "Time Series" data type.

Three required fields:
- **location_path:** Where the data goes (auto-filled from bridge location)
- **data_contract:** Leave as `_raw` for now (no validation rules)
- **tag_name:** Name your tag (data point) - we'll use `my_data`

ðŸ’¡ **What's a tag?** In industrial systems, a "tag" is a single data point - like a temperature sensor reading, motor speed, or valve position. Think of it as a variable that changes over time.

The **Always** section uses JavaScript to process messages. We're not modifying anything for now, just passing the data through.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can modify data here later (e.g., unit conversions, renaming). If you don't know JavaScript, any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude) can help write the code.

![Bridge Read Output](./images/bridge-read-output.png)

The Output section is auto-generated - it sends data to your Unified Namespace.

Click **"Save & Deploy"**.

![Bridge Read Deployed](./images/bridge-read-deployed.png)

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

You should now see:
- **Status:** Active âœ…
- **Throughput:** ~1 msg/sec

Your data is flowing!

## Step 3: View Your Data in the Topic Browser

![Topic Browser My Data](./images/topic-browser-my_data.png)

Click **"Topic Browser"** in the left menu. This shows all data in your Unified Namespace.

You'll see your data organized as a **topic**:
- `enterprise` â†’ `siteA` â†’ `_raw` â†’ `my_data`

This is the full topic path: `enterprise.siteA._raw.my_data`

Exactly as we configured it! Click on `my_data` to see details.

- Topic Details shows your bridge configuration and data location
- Last Message shows the most recent `hello world` message with timestamp
- History shows a table of recent messages (would be a chart for numeric data)
- Metadata contains additional information about the data source (we'll use this later)

## Understanding What You Built

You just created a complete data pipeline:

```text
Bridge â†’ Processing â†’ Unified Namespace â†’ Topic Browser
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Bridge:** The ONLY way data enters UMH (ensures quality and monitoring)
- **Location Path:** Organizes your data hierarchically (`enterprise.siteA`)
- **Data Contract:** Currently `_raw` (no validation rules)
- **Tag:** Your data point (`my_data`)
- **Topic:** Complete address in the UNS (`enterprise.siteA._raw.my_data`)

## What's Next?

**You have data flowing!** This is already production-ready for many use cases.

**Want to organize better?** â†’ [Continue to Step 3: Organize Your Data](2-organize-data.md)

**Connect a real device?** Simply change the protocol from "Generate" to:
- **OPC UA** for modern PLCs
- **Modbus** for older equipment
- **MQTT Subscribe** for existing MQTT devices
- [See all 50+ supported protocols â†’](https://docs.umh.app/benthos-umh/input)

## Concepts Learned

Building on the location path from Step 1, you now understand:

- **Unified Namespace (UNS)** - Event-driven data backbone that eliminates point-to-point connections ([learn more](../usage/unified-namespace/README.md))
- **Bridge** - Gateway for external data into the UNS (the only way data enters)
- **Data Flows** - Configuration area for bridges and other data pipelines
- **Protocol** - Connection method (manufacturing protocols like OPC UA, Modbus, S7, or IT protocols like HTTP)
- **Connection** - IP/hostname and port settings with latency monitoring
- **Tag** - A time-series data point (like a PLC variable)
- **Tag Processor** - JavaScript-based transformation for time-series data
- **Topic** - Complete data address: `location_path.data_contract.tag_name` ([topic convention](../usage/unified-namespace/topic-convention.md))
- **data_contract** - Data validation rules (`_raw` = no validation)
- **Topic Browser** - UI for viewing all data in the UNS
- **Throughput** - Tag updates per second for time-series data

**Pro tip:** Everything you just configured in the UI is stored as YAML. As you get comfortable, you can copy and modify these configurations for faster setup of similar devices.
