## About The Project

The Open-Source toolkit to build your own reliable and secure Industrial IoT platform.

It puts established IT and OT technologies and techniques over fancy or self-built solutions to achieve reliability, maintainability, and scalability. Furthermore, it fulfills all your security needs by allowing you to inspect and control each component to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

You can use it as a standalone end-to-end Industrial IoT platform to securely connect your machines and calculate and visualize important production KPIs like Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and Pareto charts.

Or you can use it as a toolkit and integrate its components fully into your IT/OT infrastructure to close potential gaps. As it uses open standards like Kubernetes, Docker, MQTT, OPC/UA, and relational databases it integrates very well into almost all landscapes - from Cloud over hybrid to on-premise (see also our guides in integrating it with [AWS](https://docs.umh.app/docs/getting-started/usage-in-production/#example-deployment-on-aws-eks) or [Azure](https://docs.umh.app/docs/concepts/integration-with-azure/)).
