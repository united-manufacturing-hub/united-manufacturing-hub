- Ensure all states (Active, Idle, Degraded, etc.) are clearly defined
- Add brief descriptions of what each state means operationally
**Estimated Time**: 25 minutes

### üí° Enhancement 4: Cross-Reference Improvements
**Impact**: Better navigation between related concepts
**Files**: Various
**Tasks**:
- Add glossary links for technical terms (Sparkplug, MQTT, etc.)
- Ensure all internal links use proper relative paths
- Add contextual "See also" sections where appropriate
**Estimated Time**: 40 minutes

## Execution Strategy

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
Execute Phase 1 completely - these are must-fix issues that affect functionality.

### Week 2: Consistency Pass  
Work through Phase 2 systematically, one file type at a time.

### Week 3: Enhancement Polish
Implement Phase 3 improvements based on available time and user feedback priority.

### Ongoing: Maintenance
Set up Phase 4 processes and integrate into regular workflow.

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Phases 1-3 are primarily editorial and won't break existing functionality
**Medium Risk**: Large-scale terminology changes might introduce inconsistencies if not done systematically
**Mitigation**: Use search/replace tools carefully and review changes in chunks

## Resource Requirements

**Total Estimated Time**: ~6 hours across all phases
**Skills Needed**: Technical writing, Markdown editing, basic GitBook knowledge
**Tools**: Text editor with search/replace, link checker, grammar checker
