See also the [detailed documentation](dcc-assembly-analytics.md).

### Retrofitting of weaving machines for OEE calculation

Retrofitting of weaving machines that do not provide data via the PLC to extract operating data. Subsequent determination of the OEE and detailed breakdown of the individual key figures

TODO

## Filling & packaging industry

### Performance management in a brewery

Retrofit of a bottling line for different beer types. Focus on the identification of microstops causes and exact delimitation of the bottleneck machine.

TODO

### Retrofit of a Japanese pharmaceutical packaging line

Retrofit of a Japanese pharmaceutical packaging line for automatic analysis of microstop causes as well as to relief the machine operators of data recording.

TODO

### Quality monitoring in a filling line at the Digital Capability Center Atlanta

See also the [detailed documentation](dcc-quality-check.md).

## Semiconductor industry

### Identification of optimization potential in the context of the COVID-19 crisis

Use of the factorycube for rapid analysis of bottleneck stations. The customer was thus able to increase the throughput of critical components for ventilators within the scope of COVID-19.
