# Vale Configuration for UMH Documentation
# ==========================================
#
# This configuration uses the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide
# to enforce consistent, clear, and accessible documentation.
#
# Google Style Guide enforces:
# - Consistent terminology and word choice
# - Active voice over passive voice
# - Clear and concise language
# - Proper capitalization and punctuation
# - Accessibility guidelines (e.g., avoiding ableist language)
# - Technical writing best practices
#
# To run Vale locally:
#   1. Install Vale: https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/
#   2. Sync packages: vale sync
#   3. Run linting: vale umh-core/docs/
#
# Or from this directory:
#   vale sync && vale .

# Vale.Terms creates case-sensitive substitutions from vocab that are too noisy
