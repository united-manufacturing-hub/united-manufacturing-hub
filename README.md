## About our current version 0.x.x.
Our current release, has been deployed and tested at a number of industrial sites worldwide and has proven to be stable in a variety of environments. While we have not yet reached a final version 1.0.0, this is typical for infrastructure projects that require extensive year-long testing and evaluation before a release. We are confident in the stability and reliability of our current release, which has been thoroughly tested over the past few years. As an open-source project, we welcome community involvement and feedback in the ongoing development and refinement of our software. We are committed to ensuring that our software is reliable and ready for deployment in industrial settings.
