# Verify /data is writable by umhuser (UID 1000) as documented in security model

================================================================================
ERROR: Cannot write to /data directory

The umh-core container runs as non-root user 'umhuser' (UID 1000) for security.
The mounted /data directory must be writable by this user.

To fix this, run on your host:
  sudo chown -R 1000:1000 <your-data-directory>

For details, see:
https://docs.umh.app/production/security/umh-core/deployment-security#filesystem-access

rm -f /data/.write-test

# Ensure required directories exist
mkdir -p /data/logs /data/services /data/redpanda 2>/dev/null || true
