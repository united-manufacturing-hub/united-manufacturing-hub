Please also take a look on our [guide on how to use it in production](../../getting-started/usage-in-production)!

By default MinIO is not exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster. You can connect to the MinIO console service, e.g., using Lens and your preferred browser. The default credentials are minio:minio123 for the console.
