# Overview

Data flows in UMH Core enable seamless integration between industrial devices and the unified namespace through configurable pipelines. They provide flexible mechanisms for data ingestion, transformation, and routing, allowing you to connect various protocols (OPC UA, Modbus, S7comm) to standardized data streams. Understanding the different flow types and their configurations is essential for building effective industrial data architectures.
