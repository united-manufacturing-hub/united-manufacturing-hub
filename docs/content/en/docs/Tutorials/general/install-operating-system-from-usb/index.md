## Prerequisites

- you need a bootable USB-stick (see also [flashing-a-operating-system-onto-a-usb-stick](../flashing-operating-system-on-usb/))

## Steps

1. Plug the USB-stick into the device
2. Reboot
3. Press the button to go into the boot menu. This step is different for every hardware and is described in the hardware manual. If you do not want to look it up you could try smashing the following buttons during booting (the stuff before the operating system is loaded) and hope for the best: F1, F2, F11, F12, delete
4. Once you are in the boot menu, select to boot from the USB-stick
