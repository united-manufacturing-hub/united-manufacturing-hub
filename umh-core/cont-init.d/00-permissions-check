# Verify /data is writable by umhuser (UID 1000) as documented in security model

ERROR: Cannot write to /data directory

SECURITY CHANGE: umh-core runs as non-root user 'umhuser' (UID 1000) for
enhanced security. The /data directory must be writable by this user.

Current issue: The /data directory exists but is not writable by UID 1000.
This could be due to:
- Directory owned by root (common after upgrades)
- Directory owned by another user
- Restrictive file permissions
- SELinux/AppArmor policies

To fix this, run on your host:
  sudo chown -R 1000:1000 <your-data-directory>

Note: If using SELinux, you may also need:
  sudo chcon -R -t container_file_t <your-data-directory>

After fixing permissions, restart the container.
