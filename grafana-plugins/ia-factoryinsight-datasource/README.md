This template is a starting point for building Grafana Data Source Plugins

## What is Grafana Data Source Plugin?
Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There’s a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that you’d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. Grafana Data Source Plugins enables integrating such solutions with Grafana.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies
```BASH
yarn install
```
2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode
```BASH
yarn dev
```
or
```BASH
yarn watch
```
3. Build plugin in production mode
```BASH
yarn build
```
