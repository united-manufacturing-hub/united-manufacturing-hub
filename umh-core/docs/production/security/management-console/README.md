# ManagementConsole Security

This directory will contain security documentation for the cloud-based Management Console platform.

## Topics

- **[Authentication and Authorization](authentication-and-authorization.md)** - User and instance authentication, role-based access control, and permission system

## Planned Topics

- **Cloud Infrastructure** - Cloud security architecture and compliance
- **API Security** - API authentication, rate limiting, and input validation

## Related Documentation

For Management Console documentation, see the [ManagementConsole repository](https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/ManagementConsole).

## Note

ManagementConsole security documentation is separate from umh-core security documentation:

- **umh-core** focuses on edge deployment security (containers, bridges, network)
- **ManagementConsole** focuses on cloud platform security (users, authentication, API)
