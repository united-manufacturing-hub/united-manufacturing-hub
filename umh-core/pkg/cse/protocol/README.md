## Layer 3: Network and Security Interfaces

This package provides the transport, cryptographic, and authorization interfaces for the Client-Side Encryption (CSE) system.

### Responsibilities

- **Transport interfaces**: Define how encrypted data is transmitted between components
- **Cryptographic interfaces**: Abstract encryption/decryption operations
- **Authorization interfaces**: Control access to encrypted data and keys

### Design Principles

- Protocol-agnostic: Support multiple transport mechanisms (HTTP, gRPC, message queues)
- Crypto-agnostic: Abstract underlying encryption algorithms
- Zero-trust: Assume all network communication is hostile

### Key Interfaces

- `Transport`: Send/receive encrypted messages
- `Encryptor`: Encrypt/decrypt data streams
- `Authorizer`: Verify permissions for encryption operations

### Dependencies

- **External**: Network libraries, crypto libraries
- **Internal**: None (lowest layer in CSE stack)

### Future Considerations

- Support for key rotation protocols
- Multi-tenant authorization models
- Hardware security module (HSM) integration
