## For Windows

For Windows we recommend `MobaXTerm`. 

Get the **free** Version of MobaXTerm on https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html

{{< improc SSH_windows_1.png FIT "800x500">}}MobaXTerm Session{{< /improc>}}

After starting the program, open a new `session` by selecting "Session" on the top left corner. 
Click on SSH and type in the field of "Remote Host" your IP-adress. Select "Specify Username" and type `rancher` in the following field.

{{< improc SSH_windows_2.png FIT "800x500"">}}Passwort `rancher`{{< /improc>}}

Enter the password and press enter. The default password of the auto setup will be `rancher`. There is no need to save the passoword, so just click on `no`

## For Linux

For Linux you can typically use the inbuilt commands to connect with a device via SSH. Connect using the following command:

`ssh <username>@<IP>`, e.g., `ssh rancher@192.168.99.118`.

There will be a warning saying that the authenticity of the host can't be established. Enter `yes` to continue with the connection.

Enter the password and press enter. The default password of the auto setup will be `rancher`.
