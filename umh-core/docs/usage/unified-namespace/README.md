# Unified Namespace

The Unified Namespace (UNS) is the core messaging backbone of UMH Core, providing a standardized, event-driven architecture that eliminates point-to-point integration complexity.

## Key Concepts

Traditional manufacturing systems create "spaghetti diagrams" with point-to-point connections between every system. The UNS flips this model:

- **Event-driven**: Devices publish data as events happen
- **Standard hierarchy**: Flexible location paths (supports ISA-95, KKS, or custom naming)
- **Schema enforcement**: Data contracts ensure consistent payload formats
- **Publish-regardless**: Producers don't need to know about consumers

## Documentation Structure

- **[Overview](overview.md)** - Core UNS concepts and benefits
- **[Topic Convention](topic-convention.md)** - Hierarchical naming structure (ISA-95 compatible)
- **[Payload Formats](payload-formats.md)** - Message structure and data types
- **[Producing Data](producing-data.md)** ðŸš§ - How to publish data to the UNS
- **[Consuming Data](consuming-data.md)** ðŸš§ - How to subscribe and process UNS data
