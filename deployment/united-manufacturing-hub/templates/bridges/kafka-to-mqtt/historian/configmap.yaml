    # This configuration bridges umh.v1 messages from Kafka to MQTT.
    # umh.v1.* (as we have topic/key splitting)

    ## Processors
    #
    # This part does the following:
    # 1. Reassemble the topic from the Kafka topic and key.
    # 2. Check if the reassembled topic contains the schema (_historian, etc.).
    # 3. Validate that the message is valid JSON.
    # 4. Check if we previously bridged this message, and drop it if we did.
    # 5. Add our own bridge name to the list of bridges in the payload.
    # 6. Prepare the MQTT topic by replacing dots with slashes.
